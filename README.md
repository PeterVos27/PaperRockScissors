# PaperRockScissors
My first program written without tutorials. CPU opponent who chooses attack based on random number

- You choose 1, 2 or 3 for an attack,
- The opponent chooses 1, 2 or 3 for an attack,

it will determine if you won, lost, or if it's a draw,
after which it will ask to play again. 

Upcoming is registering with name, and keep track of scores for that person.
