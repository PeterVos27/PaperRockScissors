# PaperRockScissors
My first program written without tutorials. The opponent will always win

You choose 1, 2 or 3 for an attack,

The opponent will always win over your choice,
after which it will ask to play again. 

I am currently working on this to make the responses random, hence the outcome() function has a built in exit message when it loses.

Will update frequently
